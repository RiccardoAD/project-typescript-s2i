## Typescript Project for start2impact University

Hello, this is my project about Typescript on start2impact.

This project aims to develop a typescript system that models the operating structure of a brand called Sunnee
of recycled plastic beachwear, focusing on the interactions between customers, beachwear products and sustainable production processes.

By defining interfaces and classes that represent the various components of the system, the project demonstrates how technology can support sustainable innovation for the fashion industry.

# About the code

I used only typescript.

I created interfaces and then classes that implemented the interfaces previously created.

Then I created instances to test and use the code.
